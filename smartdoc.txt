Smartdoc is a command line program that generates a cross-linked software
document in HTML format, with the following command line UI prototype.


    smartdoc SRS.txt code.py


The input is Software Requirements Specification in a plain text file
(e.g., SRS.txt) and a source code file (e.g., code.py).


The output will be SRS.html and code.html, which are meant to help
software maintainer to easily find a corresponding requirement (in
SRS.html) by clicking a link in the converted source code, code.html.


For simplicity, SRS will strictly follow the following format.


@Requirement [id=rq1] [description=???]
 Rationale  [id=ra1???] [description=???]
 TestCase   [id=tc???] [description=???]
 Priority   [Low/Medium/High]


We consider only one source code file.  We put "{see rq1}" anywhere in
the source code file (as a comment) to create a link.


A hyperlink pointing to the corresponding requirement in SRS.html will
be created in code.html.  In the meantime, a hyperlink pointing to the
corresponding function in code.html will be created in SRS.html.


SRS.html will include a Traceability Matrix for requirements and test cases.
